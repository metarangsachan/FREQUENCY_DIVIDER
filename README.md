# FREQUENCY_DIVIDER
Frequency Dividers are the circuits which divide the input frequency by n (any integer number), means if we provide some signal of frequency ‘f’ then the output will be the divided frequency ‘f/n’. Frequency dividers are very useful in analog as well as digital applications. Here we are building the circuit to divide the frequency by 2 or 4.

In this circuit, we have used Astable multivibrator by using 555 timer IC to generate input signal of frequency ‘f’. Now, in the second phase, we have used a decade counter IC 4017 to divide this input signal frequency by f/2 or f/4. Input frequency can be adjusted by using RV1 potentiometer and output frequency can be switched between f/2 and f/4 by using the SPDT switch.
